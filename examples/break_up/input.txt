Sarah: (sighs) Hey, Michael. I hope you're doing well. I know it's been a while since we caught up, but I really need to talk to someone, and you've always been such a great friend.

(softly) So, Francis and I...we broke up. It happened a few days ago, and I'm struggling to cope with it. It's been really hard on me. You know how close we were, and this just feels like a huge void in my life right now.

I remember how you were there for me when we first got together, and now, I don't know who else to turn to. I miss your comforting words, your wisdom, and your laughter. I just need my friend right now, Michael.

(voice cracking) I was wondering if we could meet up soon, maybe this weekend? I'd really appreciate your support and advice. You've always had a way of helping me see things more clearly, and I really need that right now.

I hope you're not too busy, but if you are, I completely understand. Just hearing your voice in person would mean the world to me. I could use a good friend by my side, especially right now. Let me know if you're available, and we can plan something. Thanks, Michael. I miss you and can't wait to see you.
